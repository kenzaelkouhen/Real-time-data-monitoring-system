# Real-time-data-monitoring-system
Streaming data analytics visualization system

This project entails the development of a real-time monitoring system for processing data originating from a service or application. Extensive research and evaluation have been conducted on various visualization and monitoring tools, including Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana, among others. Particular emphasis is placed on tools that facilitate real-time data visualization. 

These tools are configured and deployed within Docker containers, while the rest of the codebase is implemented in the Scala programming language. The application of this system is exemplified through a logistics chain data use case.
